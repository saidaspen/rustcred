#RustCred
Open Source is not a competition. Well actually, at RustCred, it is...

For every repo, out of the tracked repos, that you contribute to, you get a special award. 

RustCred was my first Rust project. "Rust Project?!", you might ask yourself, "But this is just simple HTLM?"... Yes, you are right. The real project is the back-end that generate the content for these pages. It's a small Rust application that queries GitHub for data and then populates the HTML.
My name is Said Aspen and I mainly do Java programming by day. I got the urge to learn Rust and got started reading The Book. After a couple of days of reading I found myself bored.
I was learning Rust to code, not to read! So, I decided to have a go at a small app. And voil√°, this is it.

This is meant to be fun. It is meant to inspire you to contribute to Rust Open Source. Don't take it too seriously.
