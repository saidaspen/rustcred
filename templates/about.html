        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
        <em>RustCred</em> was my first Rust project. <i>"Rust Project?!"</i>, you might ask yourself, <i>"But this is just simple HTLM?"</i>... Yes, you are right.
        The real project is the back-end that generates the content for these pages. It's a small Rust application that queries GitHub for data and then populates the HTML.</br>
        
        My name is <em>Said Aspen</em> and I mainly do Java programming by day. I got the urge to learn Rust and got started reading The Book. After a couple of days of reading, I found myself bored.<br/>
        I was learning Rust to code, not to read! So, I decided to have a go at a small app. And <i>voil√°</i>, this is it.
        </p>

        <p>
        <em>This is meant to be fun.</em> It is meant to inspire you to contribute to Rust Open Source. Don't take it too seriously.<br/>
        </p>
        <h1>How does it work?</h1>
        <p>
        The scores list is updated once per day. 
        Basically, gives you one award per repo, out of the <a href="trackedrepos.html">tracked repos</a>, that you have contributed to. You get a balloon, a silver medal or a gold medal depending on how many contributions you have to that repo. <br/>
        <ul>
            <li>1 contribution gives a &#x1F388;</li>
            <li>5 contribution gives a &#x1F948;</li>
            <li>10 contribution gives a &#x1F947;</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h1>How do I join?</h1>
        <p>
        Simple! Just star the <a href="https://github.com/saidaspen/rustcred">RustCred repo on GitHub</a>, and your name will pop-up on the scores list tomorrow.
        </p>
        
        <h1>Opting-out</h1>
        <p>
        If you want to star the repo on GitHub, to show me you like the project, but you don't want to end up on the scores list, then you can open a pull-request on the <a href="https://github.com/saidaspen/rustcred">RustCred repo</a> 
        to add your user name to the <a href="https://github.com/saidaspen/rustcred/blob/master/opted_out">list of users who opted out</a>.
        Once that is done, your name won't appear anymore on the scores list.
        </p>

        <h1>Adding repo to tracked repos</h1>
        <p>
        If you think a repo is missing create a pull-request on the <a href="https://github.com/saidaspen/rustcred">RustCred repo</a> to add that repo name to the <a href="https://github.com/saidaspen/rustcred/blob/master/tracked_repos">tracked_repos</a> file.
        Once that is merged, it will be considered for scores counting.
        </p>

        <h1>Why does this page look so much like Advent of Code?</h1>
        <p>
        I just love <a href="https://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a>. It is the highlight of the year. I strongly recommend participating and trying to solve some of its nuggets of programming exercises. <br/>
        Try to do them in Rust, it's a challenge, but perfectly doable!
        </p>

        <h1>Disclaimer</h1>
        <p>
        This is my side project, that I created for fun. Any changes are done on my discretion; how this site works, what repos are tracked for scores, how often it is updated, etc. <br/>
        This is meant to be fun, nothing else.
